# NineRec: A Suite of Transfer Learning Datasets for Modality-Based Recommender Systems

This repository is used for other purposes. Please use the github link in the paper. 

# Dataset
<!-- **Kindly note that collecting data and running these TransRec experiments cost us a lot of money. Our lead suggested us to release a sample of 1000 images per dataset before acceptance. If reviewers want to see the entire datasets or plan to use it now for their research, we are more than happy to provide full datasets. Feel free to inform us in the rebuttal stage.** -->

<!-- **We release a sample of 1000 images per dataset. All datasets and code (already attached here) will be provided once the paper is accepted..** -->

We have released a sample of 1000 images per dataset, and we will provide access to all datasets and code (which are already included in this submission) once the paper is accepted.

<!-- We also provide an auto-downloader to make each image easy to download and available permanently. Run `NineRec_downloader.exe` to start downloading. (still 1000 images per dataset before acceptance) -->

Additionally, we offer an auto-downloader to simplify the process of downloading each image and make them permanently available. To initiate theÂ download process, run the `NineRec_downloader.exe` file. Currently, the auto-downloader is only compatible with Windows systems, but we will provide a Linux version after acceptance.
